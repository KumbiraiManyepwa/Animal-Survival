This model predicts the likelihood that an animal brought into the shelter will die or survive before leaving the facility, using intake-related information available at the time of arrival. I used logistic regression and the model serves as a decision-making tool for animal shelter operators, adopters, the owners of the animals, veterinarians, and policy makers to identify at risk animals early and improve welfare outcomes. The model predicts whether an animal will be dead or not at the end of its stay at the shelter. This is a binary classification with 0 if its not dead and 1 if its dead. It helps come up with a probability score and a categorical label which allows end users to have a preliminary assessment to in turn assist them in prioritizing resources and high risk cases. This model is particularly useful for spotting vulnerable animals such as the very young, the injured, or those surrendered under poor conditions and intervening as early as possible. It uses logistic regression for transparency and interpretability, enabling shelter staff and stakeholders to understand how different intake factors contribute to risk. It achieves an accuracy of 86.4% on unseen test data. The data comes from City of Long Beach Animal Care Services, which publicly shares detailed records on animal intakes and outcomes. Each row in the dataset represents one animal's entry into the shelter, along with information about their condition, species, age, and eventual outcome. This model has multiple real world applications. It can be used by shelter operators to classify high risk animals upon intake and allocate medical resources more effectively. It can also be used by veterinarians and health teams to prioritize treatment for animals most likely to suffer negative outcomes. Policy makers and funders can use the prediction data to assess shelter performance and guide policy or investment decisions. The owners of the animals can also use the predictions for earlier action before they bring the animal to the shelter.
