**PROJECT TITLE:  ANIMAL SURVIVAL**

**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

**Brief overview of what the project does.**
This model predicts the likelihood that an animal brought into the shelter will die or survive before leaving the facility, using intake-related information available at the time of arrival.

**The problem it solves or the purpose it serves.**
- I used logistic regression and the model serves as a decision-making tool for animal shelter operators, adopters, the owners of the animals, veterinarians, and policy makers to  identify at risk animals early and improve welfare outcomes. 
- The model predicts whether an animal will be dead or not at the end of its stay at the shelter.
- This is a binary classification with 0 if its not dead and 1 if its dead. It helps come up with a probability score and a categorical label which allows end users to have a preliminary assessment to in turn assist them in prioritizing resources and high risk cases.
- This model is particularly useful for spotting vulnerable animals such as the very young, the injured, or those surrendered under poor conditions and intervening as early as possible.
